          <p class="lead"> I'm in my first year at the University of Waterloo's Software Engineering program. The chance to study at such a top-notch university and program
            was my goal for more than a couple years, starting just as I was entering the last 2 years of the International Baccalaureate program. I earned my I.B. Diploma in 2020, (Higher-Level Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics, Standard-Level 
            English, Economics, French). My involvements included being an executive of the school's Investors Club and part of multiple athletic teams including
            Junior Boys Soccer and Volleyball.</p>

          <p class="lead" id="align-to-right">In my free time, I love playing riffs, solos, and songs in general on my electric guitar. I discovered my love for Rock during middle school and now
            I'm entrenched in a spectrum of subgenres and I can't go a day without listening to or playing rock music (yes I know, long hair and plays rock haha).
            I also enjoy working on software development side projects and when I'm in the right mood, I even enjoy solving competitive programming questions! Also, I've been playing soccer
            practically since I was born (European and loves soccer, another clich√© wow I really am as unoriginal as they come) so I'm always ready to drop everything and
            play on the spot!</p>

          <p class="lead">One month into web development and I'm sure that this is what I want to focus my efforts on for the foreseeable future as 
            it's something I find especially satisfying and powerful. I plan on learning about many different frameworks and technologies
            like React, MongoDB, and Node.js as well as expanding on my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so that I can eventually
            become a seasoned Full-stack developer. Although I have <em>plenty</em> to learn and create before I reach that goal, this website is a playground for me to put some knowledge to use and a small step forward in the right direction. </p>
