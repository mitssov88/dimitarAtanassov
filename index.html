                As you <span id="italics">might</span> have already guessed, I'm Dimitar Atanassov and this is my first-year 
                at the University of Waterloo studying Software Engineering. Having the opportunity to study at such an innovative university program
                has been my goal since early in Grade 10 as I was entering the International Baccalaureate program. At St. Francis Xavier Secondary 
                School, I earned my I.B. Diploma in 2020, having taking Higher-Level Mathematics, Chemistry and Physics as well as Standard-Level 
                English, Economics, and French. My involvements included being an executive of the school's Investors Club and part of multiple teams including the
                Junior Boys Soccer and Volleyball teams.

                In my free time, I love playing riffs, solos, and songs in general on my electric guitar. I discovered my love for Rock during middle school and now
                I'm entrenched in a spectrum of subgenres and I can't go a day without listening to or playing rock music (yes I know, long hair and plays rock haha).
                I also enjoy working on software development side projects and when I'm in the right mood, I even enjoy solving competitive programming questions! Also, I've been playing soccer
                practically since I was born (European and loves soccer, another clich√© wow I really am as unoriginal as they come) so I'm always ready to drop everything and
                play on the spot!

                One month into Web development and I'm sure that this is what I will focus my efforts on for the foreseeable future as 
                it's something I find especially satisfying and powerful. I plan on learning about many different frameworks, technologies etc.
                such as React, MongoDB, Node.js and expanding on my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript so that I can eventually
                become a seasoned Full-stack developer. Although I have plenty to learn and create before I reach that goal, this website is a small step forward in the right direction.
